Gymnast(Jimmy) - Hey! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before, name’s Jim. So, you come here to check out the hot guys huh?
~~~~Huh?! What are you trying to say?
Hey, I’m just teasing, don’t take everything so seriously cutie…
Cutie??? I think you need to watch your attitude.
Sorry, I don’t mean anything by it Lola… Just ignore me if you want.
Lola?
Well yeah, I don’t know your name, and you look kinda like a Lola.
You could just ask me my name…
Meh, I probably won’t remember it, Lola.
~~~~~Do you count as one?
Heh, that depends on you.

I felt tired and sore… My body was aching all over.
Perhaps I pushed myself too hard.
You alright Lola? You don’t look so good.
I’m fine… just a bit dizzy
You shouldn’t be walking alone, do you want me to take you home?
~~~~~Actually yeah, that would be great.
Cool, let me just grab my equipment and we’ll get going.
You starting to like this town? I gotta say it’s gotten a lot nicer since you came.
~~~~~~No thanks, I can take care of myself.
I didn’t say that you couldn’t… Nevermind 

You should let me take you out sometime.
~~~~~Sure, I’d like to hang out with a friend.
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing! You know you aren’t that horrible to talk to.
~~~~~What do you mean by that?
Uh, you know…. two friends going out? Isn’t that a thing?
Nevermind, forget about it

I had fun going out with you…
Yeah, it was actually kinda nice to spend time outside the gym.
I know right? So I was thinking… do you want to do that more often?
I don’t see why not.
I mean… uh… 
Hm?
Would you maybe wanna go out with me?
~~~~~Of course! I like you a lot, actually.
Really? You too? Then I guess I was scared for nothing!
~~~~~I think we’re better as friends.
Oh, I get it… yeah it was kinda a stupid idea anyway. 
Sure, we’ll stay friends.

Prep(Landon) - You can stop staring… I can see you…
~~~~~~Huh, oh.... sorry.
Hm… I wonder.
Huh? Wonder about what?
Nothing that concerns you.
~~~~~Don’t flatter yourself, I wasn’t staring.
Hm, the direction of your eyes tells a different story
I don’t need you to tell me which direction I was looking, thank you very much!
Well, obviously you do.

Do you need something?
~~~~Not really, just making conversation.
Well is it possible for you to make it elsewhere?
Hmfp, and I was just starting to think we were friends.
I have no need for “friends” and at your rate you should focus more on your studies.
After all, you are quite a commoner aren’t you?
Commoner?!
Would you prefer me to say “lower class”?
Something tells me you don’t have a girlfriend…
Excellent deduction… but I fail to see how that matters.
~~~~Why are you here everyday?
Is it not ironic to ask that of me and not yourself?
It’s just a question, no need to get huffy.
Hmpf…

Why do you insist on constantly talking to me?
~~~~~I think you are a good conversationalist.
Is that so? I would think you would dislike my constant dismissiveness of you.
Somehow, I find it oddly charming.
You would be the first
~~~~~There is no one else here…
I see… Then perhaps silence is best.

I would like to propose a mutually beneficial agreement.
What does that mean?
Seeing as you are the first girl who has enough audacity to speak with me, I believe it would be suitable to upgrade the status of our relationship.
~~~~~I think I can accept that agreement.
Good, you would have been even more foolish than I thought if you declined. 
~~~~~Wait what? Are you talking about dating?
I was alluding to something of the sort, yes… 
You’ve gotta be kidding me.
You’re not interested? I am offering you quite a lot here, it would be moronic to decline.
Well then I guess I’m a moron.
Indeed.

shyguy(Holden) - Hi…
~~~~~Hi! Nice day out, huh?
Yeah… I guess...
~~~~~Are you ok? Are you waiting for someone?
No…

You come here often.
~~~~~I love being surrounded by nature, it’s really calming.
Me too. It’s quiet here.
~~~~~I like talking to you everyday.
But I don’t talk much. You do most of the talking.

You didn’t come by yesterday.
~~~~~Yeah, I was feeling a bit ill.
But you’re feeling better now?
Yup! I was probably just tired.
Good, don’t sacrifice your health.
Don’t worry… wait, you aren’t worrying about me, are you?
Of course… you’re very nice.
~~~~~Yeah, so?
Nothing, I just… noticed.
Why did you notice?
I just did...
